# shift.
faux tilt shift, an experiment. Check out the [App](https://kosamari.github.io/shift).

Made by [@kosamari](https://twitter.com/kosamari). Inspired by [Alice Bartlett's blog post](http://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/how-to-do-ok-at-slides).
For adding shadow, check out [focus.](http://kosamari.github.io/fokus/)

## How does this work ?
This app uses HTML5 Canvas and WebWorker to add blur on image while leaving focus area untouched.
